3. You can use following models for your project:
GANs / WGANs / Conditional GANs + Adversarial Training
Use synthetic data generation to address rare attack types. Possibly use conditional GANs to generate specific categories of attacks. Then feed into a classifier or even adversarially trained classifier to resist adversarial examples.

Federated Learning in IDS
Multiple devices (IoT/edge) that each has partial data; model aggregation without sharing raw data. Combine with privacy mechanisms (differential privacy or secure aggregation) to make it harder.

Autoencoders / Variational Autoencoders + Anomaly Detection
For zero-day attack detection: train VAE or denoising autoencoder on “normal” traffic, anomalies give large reconstruction error. Can be made harder by combining with clustering or other unsupervised / semi-supervised methods.

Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Deep Models
E.g. CNN + GRU / LSTM / Transformer combinations to capture both spatial features (e.g., features of packet or flow) and temporal dependencies (sequence of packets or flows). Maybe add attention layers or a transformer block to increase complexity.

Ensemble / Stacking / Voting Systems
Multiple models (ML + DL) whose outputs are combined via stacking or meta-learning. For example: RF, XGBoost, Deep Neural Network, LSTM ensemble; then a higher-level model (meta classifier) to combine outputs. Also boosting or stacking increases complexity.

Graph-based Neural Networks
If your network traffic or flows can be represented as graphs (e.g. host-to-host communications, connections as edges), then using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for detecting anomalies could be cutting-edge. Very challenging, but if you can simplify dataset appropriately, impactful.

Explainable AI / Interpretability
Alongside detection you could implement techniques for explaining why a certain flow was classified as intrusion: SHAP, LIME, Integrated Gradients, etc. Adds depth.

Adversarial Attack & Defense in IDS
Not only detection but attack the detector (craft adversarial network traffic) and defend. E.g. perturb input features; see how model degrades; apply defenses (adversarial training, input preprocessing) to harden the model.
