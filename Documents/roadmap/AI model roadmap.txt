🚀 IDS Model Roadmap
Phase 1: Baseline (Start Simple)
🔹 Model: Autoencoder (AE) / Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

Why:

Learns “normal” traffic.

Detects unknown (zero-day) attacks by high reconstruction error.

Great baseline for anomaly detection.

Training: Only on normal traffic.

Validation: Tune threshold for reconstruction error.

Testing: Use mixed normal + attack data → see if anomalies are caught.

Goal: Establish a working IDS baseline.



Phase 2: Supervised Detection (Known Attacks)
🔹 Model: CNN + LSTM (or GRU)

Why:

CNN extracts features from traffic flows (like “spatial patterns”).

LSTM/GRU captures sequence behavior (temporal patterns).

Works well for known attacks where labeled data exists.

Training: Train on labeled traffic (normal + attack types).

Validation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 for each attack type.

Testing: Test on held-out traffic → classify attack vs normal.

Goal: Stronger classifier for known attacks.




Phase 3: Synthetic Data for Rare Attacks
🔹 Model: Conditional GANs (cGANs)

Why:

Attack datasets often have imbalance (e.g., very few DoS samples).

GANs can generate synthetic attack traffic.

Improves training for supervised models (from Phase 2).

Training: GAN learns to generate rare attack types.

Validation: Evaluate quality with classifiers.

Testing: Retrain Phase 2 models with synthetic data → compare performance.

Goal: Handle imbalanced datasets.




Phase 4: Hybrid & Ensemble
🔹 Model: Stacking / Voting Ensemble

Combine:

Autoencoder (Phase 1) → anomaly detection.

CNN+LSTM (Phase 2) → known attack classification.

GAN-augmented models (Phase 3) → better rare attack handling.

Why: No single model is perfect. Ensemble increases robustness.

Training: Train each model separately, then meta-classifier (like XGBoost or simple voting).

Validation: Measure combined accuracy + false positives.

Testing: Run full dataset → evaluate “real-world” performance.

Goal: A powerful IDS with high accuracy + low false alarms.







Phase 5: Advanced Research Directions

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) → detect anomalies in network graph structures.

Federated Learning → train across multiple devices without sharing raw data.

Explainable AI (XAI) → add SHAP/LIME to explain alerts for analysts.

Adversarial Defense → test robustness against adversarial traffic.

⚙️ Training, Validation & Testing (General Process)

Training → Fit the model using training data (70%).

Validation → Tune hyperparameters, thresholds, compare models (15%).

Testing → Final performance check on unseen data (15%).

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, False Positive Rate (important for IDS).

✅ Summary:

Start: Autoencoder (Phase 1)

Next: CNN+LSTM (Phase 2)

Then: GANs for rare attacks (Phase 3)

Combine: Ensemble (Phase 4)

Finally: Explore GNN, Federated, Explainable AI (Phase 5)
