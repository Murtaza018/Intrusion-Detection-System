🚀 Advanced Features to Implement in Your IDS App
1. Explainable Alerts (XAI Integration) 🧠🔍

Don’t just say “attack detected”.

Add a reason/explanation: e.g., “SQL Injection detected because repeated suspicious query patterns matched anomaly rules.”

This helps admins understand WHY the IDS flagged traffic, reducing the “black-box” problem.

From Paper 1 (XAI IDS).

2. LLM-Powered Log & Packet Analysis 🤖📊

Use an LLM (like GPT or smaller fine-tuned models) to:

Summarize huge logs into short reports.

Classify unusual patterns into known attack categories.

Convert raw IDS alerts into plain English for non-technical users.

From Paper 2 (LLM for IDS).

3. Hybrid Detection: Rules + ML/LLM 🛡️⚡

Combine traditional signatures/rules (fast, precise) with ML/LLM anomaly detection (adaptive, learns new attacks).

Example:

Rule detects known SQL Injection.

ML flags new suspicious query style not seen before.

This hybrid approach improves accuracy + adaptability.

Inspired by both papers.
