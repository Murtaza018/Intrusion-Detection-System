Mobile App Functional Features (10+):

Design a Mobile Monitoring & Alert App for IDS systems, integrating 2–3 core advanced features drawn from future directions above (highlighted with bold):

Real-time Alert Notifications – Push alerts when anomalies detected.

Visual Explanation Dashboard – Show feature attributions via SHAP/LIME (from Topic 2 & 3 future directions).

Feedback Submission – Users can mark alerts as false positives/negatives, feeding back to retraining (Topic 3).

Live Network Graph View – Interactive visualization of network graph topology and anomaly hot-spots (Topic 2).

Adaptive Sensitivity Control – Use insights from explanations to adjust detection thresholds dynamically (Topic 3).

Embedded Self-Supervised Module – Lightweight MAE-based anomaly embedding engine runs locally for preliminary filtering (Topic 1).

Continual Learning Updates – App periodically receives model updates reflecting streaming data learning (Topic 1).

Edge Device Sync – Sync with edge nodes (e.g., routers) that run ensemble IDS components (Topic 2).

Historical Alert Analytics – Trend charts of intrusion types, volume, and performance metrics.

User-Configurable Alerts – Set custom filters (by severity, type, source IP).

Explainable Summary Reports – Generate daily/weekly summaries with explainability insights.

Edge-Local Computation – Run lightweight detection directly on-device for offline alerting (Topic 1).

Secure Authentication & Encryption – Protect app communications with IDS backend.

Model Update Management – Notifications and progress for when new detection model versions are downloaded (Topics 1 & 2).
