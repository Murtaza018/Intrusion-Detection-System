🚀 Step 1: Core Foundation (Backend + Basic Mobile App)

Backend (Module 1 – IDS Engine API)

Build a simple API in Python (FastAPI/Flask) that receives network logs and raises alerts.

Start with a lightweight ML/DL model (e.g., Isolation Forest or AE for anomaly detection).

Store alerts in PostgreSQL.

Mobile App (Module 2 – Basic UI)

Create a Flutter/React Native app with login/authentication.

Show a basic alert list (fetched from backend).

✅ At this stage: You’ll have a working “skeleton” IDS app with login + alerts.

⚡ Step 2: Real-time Monitoring & Notifications

Module 3 – Real-time Alerts

Integrate WebSockets (Socket.IO or FastAPI WebSocket) for live alerts.

Add Firebase/FCM push notifications for anomalies.

Module 4 – Historical Alert Analytics

Create backend APIs to fetch aggregated stats.

Add charts/graphs in app (use Chart.js / D3.js / Recharts).

✅ Now the app is actively notifying and showing past alert trends.

🔍 Step 3: Explainability & Feedback

Module 5 – Explainability (SHAP/LIME)

Integrate SHAP/LIME on backend models.

Send feature attribution explanations with each alert.

Mobile app: “Why flagged?” explanation dashboard.

Module 6 – User Feedback

Add “Mark as False Positive/Negative” button in app.

Store feedback in DB → connect to retraining pipeline later.

✅ At this stage: Alerts are explainable + user can give feedback.

🌐 Step 4: Advanced Network Visuals & Edge Sync

Module 7 – Live Network Graph View

Use Neo4j + NetworkX/D3.js for backend graph computation.

Mobile app: interactive graph view with anomaly hot-spots.

Module 8 – Edge Sync & Local Detection

Implement lightweight self-supervised module (MAE, small AE) for local anomaly filtering.

Sync with edge routers/devices (using MQTT or gRPC).

✅ Now IDS works across devices + gives rich visual context.

🤖 Step 5: Learning & Model Management

Module 9 – Continual Learning Updates

Backend: periodic retraining with feedback + new logs.

Mobile app: notification when model is updated.

Module 10 – Adaptive Sensitivity Control

Let users adjust detection thresholds.

Auto-adjust thresholds based on explainability insights.

✅ Now IDS is self-improving + adaptive.

🔐 Step 6: Security & Final Touch

Module 11 – Security Layer

Secure authentication (OAuth2/JWT).

Encrypt all comms with TLS + DB at rest encryption.

Module 12 – Reports & Configurable Alerts

Daily/weekly explainable reports.

User-configurable alert filters (severity/type/source IP).

✅ Final polished version: secure, customizable, and production-ready.

🗺️ Final Roadmap Flow:

Backend IDS Core + Basic Mobile App

Realtime Alerts + Analytics

Explainability + Feedback Loop

Network Graphs + Edge Sync

Continual Learning + Adaptive Sensitivity

Security + Configurable Reports
