1-Add an option for analyst [x] Enable Synthetic Expansion (Jittering).(crucial for CGAN)
2-Add an option for analyst to add new labels for a specific new zero day attack.(crucial for CGAN)
3-add an option for analyst to select multiple packets while adding them to a new label.(crucial for CGAN)
4-when the zero day attack packets are submitted to a new label,the app passes them through AE which checks Infilteration
    they are all related to each other or not.
5-give the analyst option to set the pipeline threshold themselves

1. Detection Sensitivity Preset
"Choose from pre-configured sensitivity levels: Low for reduced false alarms, Medium for balanced detection, or High for maximum threat visibility during investigations."

2. Zero-Day Hunter Sensitivity Slider
"Adjust how sensitive the AI is to unknown attacks. Lower values catch more subtle anomalies but may increase false alerts. Higher values only flag major deviations."

3. Known Attack Confidence Threshold
"Set the minimum confidence level required to flag known attack patterns. Lower values detect more potential threats, higher values only alert on high-confidence matches."

4. Alert Volume Control
"Control how chatty the system is: Quiet mode for critical alerts only, Normal for balanced reporting, or Verbose for maximum visibility during incident response."

5. Operational Mode Selector
"Switch between pre-tuned modes: Business Hours for normal operation, Night Mode for reduced alerts, Incident Response for maximum detection, or Pentest mode for security testing."

6. Advanced Autoencoder Settings Panel
"Fine-tune the statistical engine: adjust how many standard deviations from normal trigger alerts, what percentile of normal traffic sets the baseline, and how much learning data is required."

7. Time-Based Auto-Adjustment Toggle
"Automatically lower sensitivity during business hours when traffic is expected, and raise it at night when any activity is more suspicious."

8. Threshold Profile Manager
"Save and load your favorite threshold combinations for different scenarios - create profiles for 'Quiet Nights', 'Active Monitoring', or 'Security Audits'."

9. Live Threshold Visualization
"See real-time graphs showing current traffic patterns against your detection thresholds - watch how normal traffic behaves and where anomalies appear."

10. One-Click Threshold Deployment
"Apply new sensitivity settings immediately without restarting the detection pipeline - see changes take effect in real-time."

11. Factory Reset Button
"Instantly restore all thresholds to safe default values with a single click if you've made things too sensitive or missed something important."

12. Impact Preview Display
"See how your current threshold settings would have classified recent network traffic - understand the trade-off between detection and false alarms before committing."

13. Analyst Notes Field
"Add comments to your threshold profiles explaining why you chose these settings - perfect for team handovers or compliance documentation."

14. Threshold History Timeline
"Review how your sensitivity settings have evolved over time and which configurations worked best during past security incidents."

15. Export Threshold Settings
"Share your finely-tuned detection profiles with other team members or backup your optimal configurations for disaster recovery."
