Adversarial Attack and Defense->Autoencoder

1-Adversarial Attack and Defense:hardened version of CNN+LTSM,it even predicts attacks that are designed to bypass AI based IDS.It has a 
    low false positives(normals predicted as attacks) and low false negatives(attacks predicted as normals) rates making
    it an efficient first line of defense.
2-Autoencoder:It is used to detect zero-day attacks not because it predicts attacks better overall, but because its job is to spot anything that deviates from normal, 
    even things it has never seen before. Its extreme sensitivity (which causes the high false positives) is exactly what makes it a good "safety net" for catching
    novel threats that the DNN might miss.
