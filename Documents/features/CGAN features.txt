when the analyst wants to fine tune the main model,they will select multiple packets which will then go to main model(adversarial)
which will then see if the given packets are similar or not,if not similar,give error,if similar,proceed to cgan data generation,
if the data packets are below a certain threshold,we will perform jittering(to create more packets from a few by slightly changing some values)
after this,the packets go into cgan for data generation which will be used to fine tune main model.
