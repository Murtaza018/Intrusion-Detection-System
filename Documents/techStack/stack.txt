Detailed components & recommended technologies
1) Mobile client (monitoring + actions)

Primary: React Native (TypeScript)
Why: Fast cross-platform UI, huge ecosystem, supports native modules for ML (TFLite, ONNX).
Alternatives: Flutter (Dart) — great performance and UI.

Key libs & tools

UI: React Native + React Navigation + NativeBase / React Native Paper

State: Redux Toolkit or Recoil

Networking: axios / react-query (for caching)

Local DB: SQLite (react-native-sqlite-storage) or WatermelonDB (better for large local datasets)

Push: Firebase Cloud Messaging + react-native-firebase

Offline ML runtime: ONNX Runtime Mobile or TensorFlow Lite (via native bridge)

Secure storage: react-native-keychain for tokens

OTA updates: CodePush (App Center) for JS bundle updates; full binary updates via Play Store / App Store

Mobile-side ML features

Lightweight MAE inference: run ONNX-converted encoder locally for preliminary filtering (item 7 & 13).

Local detection fallback: run a tiny LOF or thresholding on-device for offline alerts.

Explainability UI: render SHAP bar charts sent from backend (or compute SHAP on-device for a very small explainer).

2) Backend & API

Primary: Node.js (TypeScript) + Express or NestJS (more structured)
Alternative: Python FastAPI (if you want Python full-stack & simplify ML integration)

Responsibilities

Accept telemetry from edge & mobile

Host REST/gRPC for control, push triggers for notifications

Manage authentication, user and device config, alert history

Provide explainability endpoints (SHAP/LIME results), model management endpoints

Relay model updates and retraining jobs to MLOps

Key libs

API: Express / NestJS (TypeScript)

Websockets: socket.io or ws

Task queues: BullMQ (Redis) or Celery (if Python)

Authentication: OAuth2/OIDC via Keycloak or Auth0

Secrets: HashiCorp Vault

3) Streaming, eventing & edge sync

Primary: Apache Kafka (Confluent or MSK) for high-throughput telemetry
Alternative: MQTT (EMQX / Mosquitto) for lightweight edge devices

Notes

Use MQTT for low-power IoT devices and downstream Kafka on the cloud using bridge connectors.

Kafka Connect for ingesting into DBs, S3, or processing pipelines.

Use topics for: raw-flows, preprocessed, alerts, feedback, model-updates.

4) ML research & training stack

Primary languages: Python (3.10+)
Libraries

Deep learning: PyTorch (preferred) or TensorFlow

MAE: timm / torchvision transformers or custom encoder-decoder

AutoML / HPO: Optuna

Preprocessing: pandas, scikit-learn

Anomaly detectors: scikit-learn (LOF), PyOD

Explainability: SHAP, LIME, ELI5

Tabular-to-image: DeepInsight pipeline (scikit-learn + openTSNE / umap-learn)

Notebook env: Jupyter / JupyterLab

Model formats

Export to ONNX for edge/mobile (ONNX Runtime)

Optionally export to TorchScript for TorchServe

5) Model serving & inference

Primary: Triton Inference Server or TorchServe
Alternative: FastAPI + Uvicorn + Gunicorn for custom endpoints

Serving patterns

Online ensemble server: low-latency endpoint for full models (XGBoost/CatBoost/Torch)

Explainer jobs: batch or on-demand SHAP calculations (heavy)

Edge update server: host lightweight encoders/MAE weights packaged as ONNX/TFLite

Autoscaling

Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, configure GPU nodes for heavy model serving.

6) Feature store & data storage

Feature store: Feast (store feature vectors for training/serving)

Blob storage: S3-compatible (Amazon S3 or MinIO) for raw pcap/flows and artifacts

Relational DB: PostgreSQL (user/accounts, metadata)

Timeseries DB: InfluxDB or TimescaleDB (for telemetry / metrics / alert counts)

Search & analytics: ElasticSearch (for logs & fast searches)

Vector DB (if using embedding search for anomaly contexts): Milvus or Weaviate

7) Explainability & user-facing explanations

Compute global explanations (feature importances) offline using SHAP/TreeExplainer for tree-based models (fast).

For per-alert explanations: compute local SHAP values (or LIME) on request and cache results.

Expose formatted explainability payload:

{
  "top_features":[{"name":"sttl","value":0.12,"shap":0.45}, ...],
  "global_importances": [...],
  "explanation_text":"The high ct_srv_dst and low sttl indicate..."
}


Visualize in the mobile app with small bar charts and sparkline trends. Heavy explainability computation should remain server-side.

8) Feedback loop & continual learning

Feedback capture: mobile app sends user labels (false positive/neg) back to backend via secure REST endpoints or Kafka topic user-feedback.

Data pipeline:

Feedback → staging DB → label validator (human-in-the-loop optional) → training dataset

Retraining & model promotion:

Use Kubeflow / Airflow to orchestrate model retraining pipelines.

Use Canary deployments for new models (A/B), rollbacks available.

Model registry: MLflow or Seldon Model Registry for versions & metadata.

9) Edge device & local inference

Edge runtime: ONNX Runtime or TensorFlow Lite (for ARM devices and routers)

Edge sync: MQTT for commands, SFTP / HTTPS for model downloads, or CIOT agent (custom) that checks for signed updates

Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4/Compute Module for prototyping; NVIDIA Jetson family for GPU-enabled edge inference

Edge components: lightweight ensemble (signature rules + MAE encoder + a small LOF) to pre-filter flows and send only suspicious flows to cloud

10) Notifications & UX features

Push: FCM (Android) + APNs (iOS) via server FCM API

In-app filtering: send minimal alert payload to mobile; fetch richer explainability only on demand to save bandwidth

User-configurable alerts: store user filtering preferences in Postgres; enforce server-side filters to avoid over-pushing

11) Security & compliance

Authentication: Keycloak (OpenID Connect) or Auth0; multi-tenant support if needed

Authorization: RBAC + field-level permissions

Encryption: TLS 1.3 everywhere; AES-256 at rest for DBs & S3 objects

Secrets: HashiCorp Vault for keys & certificates

Mutual TLS: between edge devices and backend for trust

Audit logging: WORM logs in ElasticSearch / S3 for compliance

Penetration testing: periodic security scans + SAST/DAST in CI

12) Observability & ops

Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards (alerts/sec, model drift, latencies)

Traces: Jaeger / OpenTelemetry

Logs: Filebeat → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana (ELK)

Alerting: Alertmanager for infra alerts; mobile critical alerts via push

13) DevOps & CI/CD

Containers: Docker, images stored in ECR/GCR/ACR

K8s: EKS / GKE / AKS; manage with Helm charts

Pipelines: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to run tests, build images, push artifacts, trigger deployments

Infra as Code: Terraform + Terragrunt

Secrets & config: SOPS / Vault integration for encrypted configs

Data & model flow (interaction summary)

Edge routers / agents collect flows, run lightweight MAE/LOF locally —> suspicious flows pushed to cloud via MQTT/Kafka.

Cloud ingestion: Kafka topic → preprocessing service → feature store → model inference service.

Inference: Ensemble (MAE encoder + XGBoost/CatBoost + LOF) yields alerts + explainability metadata (SHAP).

Notifications: Backend pushes alert notification to mobile via FCM; mobile may request detailed SHAP explanation.

Feedback: Mobile sends FP/FN flags → feedback topic → retraining pipelines.

Model updates: Trained/validated models packaged as ONNX/TFLite and published to edge update endpoints; update managed via signed manifests and device agent.

Deployment & sizing notes

Small PoC: single cloud VM (t3.large), PostgreSQL managed, Kafka single-node or managed (Confluent), simple k8s (k3s).

Production: k8s cluster, separate worker and GPU node pools, managed Kafka (MSK/Confluent), multi-AZ Postgres (RDS), S3 for storage, autoscaling Triton/TorchServe.

Edge scale: for thousands of devices, prefer MQTT brokers (EMQX) with bridge to Kafka; use device gateway and certificate-based auth.

Quick implementation roadmap (3 milestones)

Final suggestions & best practices

Start simple: get push alerts, feedback, and logging working before heavy ML.

Keep explanations lightweight: compute heavy SHAP in batch or on-demand with caching.

Model governance: maintain model registry and A/B test every update.

Privacy: aggregate or anonymize IPs before storing long-term, comply with GDPR-like rules.

Testing: simulate attacks in staging for reliability (use pcap corpora, synthetic attacks).
