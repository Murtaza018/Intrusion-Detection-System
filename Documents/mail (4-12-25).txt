1. Things we have done and don't need to change
These elements are already implemented in your project and align well with the "Future Directions" or methodologies described in the provided texts.

Explainable AI (XAI) Integration (Topic 2 & 3):

Text Reference: "Integrating SHAP or LIME modules to interpret predictions" and "Enhancing transparency and interpretability."

Your Project: You have fully integrated SHAP (KernelExplainer). Your system explains exactly why a packet was flagged (e.g., "Increased risk: Flow Duration").

Visualization Dashboards (Topic 3):

Text Reference: "Build explainability dashboards that show feature contribution to each alert in real time."

Your Project: Your Flutter Frontend does exactly this. It displays packets in real-time, shows risk levels, and visualizes top contributing factors with color-coded indicators.

Handling Data Imbalance (Topic 2):

Text Reference: "It uses SMOTE for imbalance."

Your Project: You went a step further. Instead of standard SMOTE, you implemented a WGAN-GP (Generative Adversarial Network) to generate synthetic zero-day attacks. This is a more advanced method of handling imbalance and data augmentation.

Anomaly-Based Detection (Topic 1 & 2):

Text Reference: Uses "Autoencoders" for detection.

Your Project: You have a dedicated Autoencoder model specifically for detecting Zero-Day anomalies based on reconstruction error thresholds.

2. Things we have done but done "incorrectly" (or differently) and should change/evolve
These are areas where we have a foundation, but the provided text suggests a more advanced or automated approach that we should consider adopting to match State-of-the-Art (SOTA).

Continual Learning Loop (Topic 1):

Text Reference: "Real-time continual learning loop that updates on streaming network traffic."

Current Status: We have the components (WGAN for generation, "Report False Positive" button), but the actual loop is manual.

Change Needed: We need to automate the pipeline so that when the analyst verifies a Zero-Day or False Positive, the system automatically triggers the fine_tune and retrain scripts without you running them manually.

User Feedback Loop (Topic 3):

Text Reference: "Allow security operators to provide feedback on explanations, improving model over time."

Current Status: We added the "Report False Positive" button in the UI, but currently, it just logs to a text file (false_positives.log).

Change Needed: This needs to connect to the "Immunization" workflow we discussed (Jittering -> Retraining) to actually improve the model, not just log the error.

The Detection Model Architecture (Topic 2):

Text Reference: "Hybrid ensemble system combining XGBoost, Random Forest, GNN, LSTM, and Autoencoders... employs weighted soft-voting."

Current Status: We use a sequential pipeline (CNN -> Autoencoder).

Change Needed: To match this research, we would need to move from a single CNN classifier to an Ensemble. However, this is a major architectural change. A middle ground would be adding an LSTM or XGBoost model alongside your CNN and averaging their predictions (Voting) to improve accuracy.

3. Things we have NOT done
These are concepts from the text that are completely absent from our current architecture.

Tabular-to-Image Transformation with MAE (Topic 1 - SAFE):

Concept: Converting the 78 traffic features into an image format and using Masked Autoencoders (like in computer vision) to find anomalies.

Status: We treat data as tabular vectors. We have not explored image conversion.

Graph Neural Networks (GNN) (Topic 2):

Concept: Modeling network traffic as a graph (nodes = IP addresses, edges = flows) and using GNNs to detect attacks based on the topology and relationships between devices.

Status: Our models look at single packets/flows in isolation. We do not analyze the graph structure of the network.

PCA-based Novelty Detection (Topic 1 - CND-IDS):

Concept: Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to flag novel attacks.

Status: We use a Deep Autoencoder for this. (Note: Deep Autoencoders are often considered superior to PCA for complex non-linear data, so we might not want to do this, but we haven't done it).

Edge Deployment Optimization (Topic 1 & 2):

Concept: Adapting models to run on routers or gateways with limited resources.

Status: We are running on a PC/Laptop using full TensorFlow/Keras. We have not converted models to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) or optimized them for low-power edge devices.
