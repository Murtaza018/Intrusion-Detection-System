You got it. For a complete and effective setup, here is the single best combination to choose.

For building the IDS core, use Scapy. For simulating and testing, use GNS3 to create the network and Metasploit to generate attacks.


## üêç For Your IDS Core: Scapy (Python)
Scapy is the definitive choice for developing your IDS.

Why it's the best choice: It's more than just a packet sniffer; it's a complete packet manipulation tool. You can use the same library to build your detection engine and to craft specific packets for unit-testing your detection rules. This versatility is unmatched. Since your IDS will have a custom logic backend, Scapy integrates perfectly into any Python application, allowing you to feed alerts to your Material UI front-end.


## üî¨ For Your Testing Environment: GNS3 + Metasploit
This combination gives you a professional-grade virtual lab to safely test your IDS against realistic threats.

Network Simulator: GNS3

Why it's the best choice: GNS3 allows you to build realistic network topologies using a drag-and-drop interface.  It seamlessly integrates with virtualization software like VirtualBox or VMware, so you can drop in full-fledged virtual machines to act as your attacker and victim. This is far more realistic than script-based simulators for testing a security tool.

Attack Generation Tool: Metasploit Framework

Why it's the best choice: Metasploit is the industry-standard tool for penetration testing. It contains a massive database of real-world exploits you can launch from your "attacker" VM against your "victim" VM. Testing against Metasploit will prove your IDS can handle actual attack techniques, not just theoretical ones.


‚≠ê Your Recommended Workflow
Here is how you'll put it all together:

Build the Lab in GNS3: Create a simple network with three virtual machines:

An Attacker VM (running a Linux distro like Kali Linux, which has Metasploit pre-installed).

A Victim VM (running an intentionally vulnerable OS like Metasploitable2).

Your IDS VM/Host where you run your Scapy script. Position this so it can monitor traffic between the attacker and the victim.

Start Your IDS: Run your Python script using Scapy on the IDS machine to begin monitoring the virtual network.

Launch Attacks: From the Kali Linux VM, use Metasploit to launch exploits against services running on the Metasploitable2 VM.

Verify Detection: Watch your IDS. If it's working correctly, you should see alerts being generated in real-time as Metasploit's traffic crosses the network.

Standardized Testing (Optional but Recommended): Use a tool called TCPreplay to replay pre-recorded attack traffic (.pcap files) through your GNS3 network to test specific, known signatures.
