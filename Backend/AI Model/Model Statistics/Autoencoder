ðŸ”¹ Insights

Good ROC-AUC (0.8663) â†’ AE learned to separate normal vs. attack fairly well.

High Recall for Normal (0.91) â†’ Most normal traffic is correctly identified.

Lower Recall for Attacks (0.66) â†’ Some attacks are missed (false negatives).

Balanced Precision/Recall, but not perfect â†’ Expected for Phase 1 baseline.
